### Child Development Account (CDA)
The CDA is a special savings account for your child. The First Step Grant is deposited automatically, and the Government will co-match your savings, up to a cap.

- **First Step Grant:** $5,000 automatically deposited into the CDA for all birth orders.
- **Government Co-matching:** The government co-matches dollar-for-dollar, with an increased cap of $1,000 for children in the first and second birth orders. The government will co-match 3 days after the amount is deposited into the CDA. For example, if $100 is saved in the CDA on 1 Jan 2024, the government will co-match and deposit $100 into the CDA on 4 Jan 2024.

CDA savings can be used for:
- Registered childcare, kindergartens, and special education fees
- Medical expenses at healthcare institutions
- Premiums for MediShield Life or MediSave-approved plans
- Approved healthcare items at pharmacies, etc.

**Note:** Any savings left in the CDA after age 12 will be transferred to the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA).
