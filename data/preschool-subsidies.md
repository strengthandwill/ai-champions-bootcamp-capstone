A common concern of many Singaporeans is that their retirement savings will not last till they are old. This is especially true when they do not have a steady income stream post-retirement.

Taking into account your CPF for retirement planning is a natural first step for most Singaporeans as they would have accumulated CPF savings during their working lives.

To ensure a solid foundation for your retirement years, it’s useful to understand the options available and how to make the most out of your CPF savings. Let’s dive in and explore what the CPF retirement sum means for you!

### Understanding the Retirement Sum (RS)

You might have heard about the term “minimum sum”, but do you know it was renamed to the “retirement sum” in 2016?

In essence, the retirement sum (RS) is a reference point that provides an indication of how much you need to save to meet your desired monthly payouts.

There are three levels of retirement sums to note:

- **Basic Retirement Sum (BRS):** Provides monthly payouts in retirement to cover basic living needs, excluding rental expenses.
- **Full Retirement Sum (FRS):** An ideal point of reference for how much one needs in retirement.
- **Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS):** Provides a higher monthly payout, suitable for those who might require more retirement income.

### How is My Retirement Sum (RS) Calculated?

When you turn age 55, the savings from your Special Account (SA), followed by your Ordinary Account (OA), will be transferred to a newly opened Retirement Account (RA).

The amount to be transferred is capped at the FRS as a reference of how much you might need for retirement. The amount of CPF savings in your RA will ultimately determine your future monthly payouts.

> **TIP:** If you wish to receive higher payouts for your desired retirement lifestyle, you can choose to set aside more by making a top-up to the current ERS.

Unlike the BRS and FRS, which are fixed according to your year of birth, the ERS increases yearly and is the maximum amount that CPF members can top up to.

The BRS and FRS are adjusted annually as long-term inflation, life expectancy, and improvements in the standard of living are considered. The retirement sum you need to set aside depends on when you turn 55 and is fixed for the rest of your life. Hence, your retirement sum might differ from a friend’s if you are of a different age.

> **TIP:** If you own a property in Singapore with a lease lasting until you are 95 years or older, you can meet your FRS with a mixture of property (up to half your FRS) and cash.

If you are born in 1958 or after and have at least $60,000 in your RA when you start your monthly payouts, you will automatically be included in **CPF LIFE** – a national longevity insurance annuity scheme that provides monthly payouts no matter how long you live.

The government will announce the retirement sums ahead of time to help CPF members reaching age 55 prepare for retirement.

For higher monthly payouts, members age 55 and above can top up their RA up to the current ERS, regardless of when they turn 55.

**ERS for 2024–2027**

| Year | Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| 2024 (current) | $308,700 |
| 2025 | $426,000 |
| 2026 | $440,800 |
| 2027 | $456,400 |

The ERS is set at three times the BRS. From 2025, the ERS will be raised to four times the BRS to allow members to voluntarily top up more for higher payouts.

### Options to Grow Your CPF Savings

If you have not met your FRS or BRS by age 55, you can still receive your payouts at age 65. However, these payouts may be lower than expected, so it’s essential to plan accordingly.

**Ways to Get Higher Payouts in Retirement**:

1. **Top Up to the Current ERS**  
   To enjoy higher payouts, consider cash top-ups to your RA (up to your current ERS). You’ll also receive tax relief of up to $16,000 a year for cash top-ups to both yourself and loved ones (up to the current FRS).  
   _Login to your Retirement Dashboard to view your top-up amount._

2. **Receive Matching Grant on Cash Top-Ups**  
   Eligible individuals can receive a dollar-for-dollar grant (up to an annual cap of $600) through the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) for top-ups made to their RA.  
   _From 1 January 2025, MRSS will be enhanced to help eligible members save more for retirement._

### Laying the Foundations for a Solid Retirement Plan

The BRS and FRS serve as valuable guides to assist you in planning for retirement. By keeping the retirement sum in mind, you can better plan for your golden years based on your desired retirement lifestyle.

Try using the **CPF Planner** (for those under age 54) or the **Plan My Payouts Tool** (for those age 65 and above) to plan your retirement with CPF.
