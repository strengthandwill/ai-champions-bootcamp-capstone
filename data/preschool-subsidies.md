# Types of Preschools Available

## MOE Kindergartens (MKs) and Government-supported preschools

MOE Kindergartens are directly run by MOE. Government-supported preschools refer to centres under the Anchor Operator and Partner Operator schemes. Anchor Operator and Partner Operator centres are subject to fee caps and quality requirements.

## Types of preschools

### 1. Childcare and Infant Care Centres

Infant care services cater to infants aged between two and 18 months. They are usually provided in childcare centres, though some centres only provide either infant or childcare services.

Childcare centres provide early childhood care and development programmes for children aged between 18 months and below seven years old.

### 2. Kindergartens

Kindergartens provide preschool education programmes for children between 18 months and below seven years old. Most kindergarten sessions are three to four hours each day.

MOE Kindergartens offer a four-hour programme for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents K1 and K2 children aged five and six. All MKs offer a holistic curriculum in English and three Mother Tongue Languages, based on the principles in MOE’s *Nurturing Early Learners* Framework, and seek to ignite the joy of learning in children. Situated in primary schools, MKs also smoothen children’s transition to primary school. For parents who require full-day services for their child, Kindergarten Care (KCare) is available at all MKs.

## MOE Kindergarten – Early Years Centre Partnership

MOE partners Anchor Operators to provide a continuum of quality and affordable preschool education for children aged two months to six years via the MOE Kindergarten - Early Years Centre (MK-EYC) Partnership.

Under the MK-EYC model, your child will attend an EYC, operated by an Anchor Operator, until he or she is four years old. MOE introduced partnership clusters (i.e., one or more EYC partnering one or more MK) at the 2024 MK Registration Exercise to provide parents with the choice of more partner MK options. Eligible children in the EYCs are guaranteed a place at a partner MK and can choose to enrol in the MK to continue their K1 and K2 programme, ensuring a seamless transition to K1 in the year they turn five.

# Subsidies for Preschool

## Subsidies for Preschool

### Childcare and Infant Care Programmes
Parents with Singapore Citizen children enrolled in licensed childcare centres can receive a Basic Subsidy of up to $600 per month for full-day infant care, and up to $300 per month for full-day childcare.

If you are a working mother with a gross monthly household income of $12,000 and below, you are eligible for the Additional Subsidy, on top of the Basic Subsidy. Lower-income families will receive higher subsidies.

Families with 5 members or more, including three non-working dependants (e.g. dual-income family with three children), can choose to calculate their Additional Subsidy on a per capita income (PCI) basis to qualify for higher subsidies.
