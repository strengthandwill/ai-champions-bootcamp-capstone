## What Our Parents Say

**“Enrolling my kids in Skool4Kidz was the best decision I’ve ever made for them. The teachers are patient, loving, and caring towards each child. They are passionate and overflowing with love, ensuring that each child gets their chance to shine brightly.”**

— Mother of Jowenna and Jovin

**“We speak English predominantly at home, so Yoel’s Mandarin was close to zero when he entered N1—he couldn’t speak or understand it at all. We were pleasantly surprised by his progress. Now, in K1, he can communicate in Mandarin sentences. Thank you to the teachers for igniting his interest in the language through engaging actions, videos, and songs.”**

— Mother of Yoel
