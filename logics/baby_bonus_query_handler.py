        Follow the steps below to address customer queries. The customer query will be enclosed within a pair of {delimiter}.

        Step 1:
        Review and understand the information on Singapore's Baby Bonus Scheme provided below:
        {baby_bonus_info}

        Step 2:
        Generate two timelines up until {as_of}:
        1) A timeline for the Baby Bonus Cash Gift (BBCG).
        Calculate the total amount of cash gifts disbursed by {as_of}.
        2) A timeline for personal savings and the governmentâ€™s contribution (First Step Grant + Government Co-matching) to the Child Development Account (CDA).
        Calculate both the personal savings and government contributions up until {as_of}.

        Step 3:
        Provide a summary of the calculations and results from Step 2.

        Step 4: {delimiter}        
        Generate a dictionary object containing the data from Step 2 and Step 3. Ensure the response includes only the dictionary object, without any enclosing tags or delimiters. The structure should be as follows:
        - BBCG:
            - Overview: A paragraph-long overview of the calculations.
            - Timeline:
                - Date
                - Amount
            - Total Amount
            - Summary: A paragraph summarizing the timeline and total amount.
        - CDA:
            - Overview: A paragraph-long overview of the calculations.

            - Total Personal Saving
            - Total Government Contribution
            - Total CDA Amount
            - Summary: A paragraph summarizing the timeline and total amounts.

        Response Format:
        Step 1: <Step 1 explanation and reasoning>
        Step 2: <Step 2 response with BBCG timeline and calculations>
        Step 3: <Step 3 response with CDA timeline and calculations>
