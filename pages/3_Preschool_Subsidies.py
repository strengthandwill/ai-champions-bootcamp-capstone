        Parents of Singapore Citizen children enrolled in licensed childcare centres can access financial support through government subsidies. The Basic Subsidy provides:
        - Up to $600 per month for full-day infant care.
        - Up to $300 per month for full-day childcare.
        
        Working mothers with a gross monthly household income of $12,000 or below are eligible for the Additional Subsidy, offering further assistance. Lower-income families qualify for higher subsidies.
                   
        Families with **five or more members**, including three non-working dependants, can opt to calculate their subsidy based on **per capita income (PCI)** to access higher subsidies.
