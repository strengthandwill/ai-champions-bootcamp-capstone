## üìÑ Project Overview

This capstone project is part of the GovTech AI Champions Bootcamp, focusing on developing AI solutions that elevate government services. The project aims to create a user-friendly interface for parents to access financial support information, particularly through the Baby Benefits Calculator.

## üçº App Information

The **Baby Benefits Calculator** leverages the OpenAI API to quickly calculate the available benefits based on the information you provide. It empowers parents by simplifying the understanding of government support for child-rearing expenses.

### Baby Bonus Scheme

The **Baby Bonus Scheme** is designed to assist parents in managing the financial costs associated with raising a child. The scheme includes two key components:

1. **Baby Bonus Cash Gift (BBCG)**: A cash gift provided to parents to help with early-stage child-rearing expenses.
2. **Child Development Account (CDA) Benefits**, which offer:
   - A **First Step Grant** to kickstart the child's savings.
   - **Government co-matching** of parents‚Äô contributions to the CDA, helping to grow the savings further for the child‚Äôs developmental needs.

In 2023, the scheme was enhanced to provide greater benefits for families, specifically for children born on or after **14 February 2023**, making it even more advantageous for new parents.

### Childcare Subsidies

Parents of Singapore Citizen children enrolled in licensed childcare centres can access financial support through government subsidies. The **Basic Subsidy** provides:
- Up to **$600 per month** for full-day infant care.
- Up to **$300 per month** for full-day childcare.

Working mothers with a gross monthly household income of **$12,000 or below** are eligible for the **Additional Subsidy**, which offers further assistance. Lower-income families qualify for higher subsidies.

Families with **five or more members**, including three non-working dependants, can opt to calculate their subsidy based on **per capita income (PCI)** to access higher subsidies.
